## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass (scss)

### What I learned

In this project, I got to put my css grid skills to work. I have used them in the past, but was quite rusty before this project. I am happy with how it turned out!

This is my second project using *Sass*, and I quite like it!

### Continued development

I would like to:

- Continue learning how to utilize *Sass* to it's utmost potential
- Work on refining my semantic html
- Work on more consistent and frequent git pushes, rather than pushing a bunch of changes at once
